<h2>My Top 3 movies and Stories behind them.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jatt And Juliet</h3>
<p>This movie is a light,great laugh one.Perfect if you are punjabi, love diljit and are looking for some fun with family. </p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>You will never dream the same.This was one of first movies that i watched. Quite serious and mind numbing one, at least for me. Always has a place in my heart.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<p>The first fantasy-out of my curiculum-fun read.So obviously would watch the movie if given the chance and i have watched the whole 7 movies like 2 times.A great binge watch. </p>
